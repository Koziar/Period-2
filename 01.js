    1. Why would you consider a scripting language as JavaScript as your backend platform?

/*

 I would consider JavaScript as my backend platform depending on a project I would be currently working on.
 If it would be something heavy, complex, with a complicated structure. I would not go with JS.
 My choice would be Java instead. Because that's what this programming-language is good at.
 Java is a much larger and more complicated language that creates "standalone" applications.
 It's structured and delivers solid engineering and architecture.

 Scripting languages, like JavaScript, are super fast, it doesn't have to be compiled
 (because it runs on the browser only) and sometimes measured up to 20x faster than code
 written in Java or any other alternative. Itâ€™s simple and flexible.
